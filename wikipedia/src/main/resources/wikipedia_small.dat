These extension modules can then be loaded and used by regular Python code using the import statement. Cython is written in Python and works on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Mac OS X]], producing source files compatible with CPython 2.4 through 3.4.  It works by producing a standard Python module. However, the behavior differs from standard Python in that the module code, originally written in '''Python''', is translated into '''C'''. While the resulting code is fast, it makes many calls into the CPython interpreter and CPython standard libraries to perform actual work. Choosing this arrangement saved considerably on Cython's development time, but modules have a dependency on the Python interpreter and standard library.  Although most of the code is C-based, a small stub loader written in interpreted Python is usually required (unless the goal is to create a loader written entirely in C, which may involve work with the undocumented internals of CPython). However, this is not a major problem due to the presence of the Python interpreter.  == Sample program == [[File:Cython CPython Ext Module Workflow.png|thumb|Hello World in Cython]]  A sample [[hello world]] program for Cython is unusually involved{{weasel inline|date=February 2015}} because it interfaces with the Python C API and the <code>distutils</code> extension building facility. At least three files are required for a basic project:  * A <code>setup.py</code> file to invoke the <code>distutils</code> build process that generates the extension module * A main python program to load the extension module * Cython source file(s)  The following code listings demonstrate the build and launch process:  <source lang="Python"> # hello.pyx - Python Module, this code will be translated to C by Cython. def say_hello():     print "Hello World!" </source>  <source lang="Python"> # launch.py - Python stub loader, loads the module that was made by Cython.  # This code is always interpreted, like normal Python. # It is not compiled to C.  import hello hello.say_hello() </source>  <source lang="Python"> # setup.py - unnecessary if not redistributing the code, see below from distutils.core import setup from Cython.Build import cythonize  setup(name = 'Hello world app',       ext_modules = cythonize("*.pyx")) </source>  These commands build and launch the program:  <source lang="Bash"> $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace $ python launch.py </source>  == History == Cython is a derivative of the [[Pyrex (programming language)|Pyrex language]], and supports more features and optimizations than Pyrex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.cython.org/DifferencesFromPyrex|title=Differences between Cython and Pyrex}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ewing|first=Greg|url=http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2011-March/109642.html|title=Re: VM and Language summit info for those not at Pycon (and those that are!)|type=Message to the electronic mailing-list <tt>python-dev</tt>|date=21 March 2011|accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref>  Cython was forked from Pyrex in 2007 by developers of the [[Sage (mathematics software)|Sage]] computer algebra package, because they were unhappy with Pyrex's limitations and could not get patches accepted by Pyrex's maintainer Greg Ewing, who envisioned a much smaller scope for his tool than the Sage developers had in mind. They then forked Pyrex as SageX. When they found people were downloading Sage just to get SageX, and developers of other packages (including Stefan Behnel, who maintains the [[XML]] library LXML) were also maintaining forks of Pyrex, SageX was split off the Sage project and merged with <tt>cython-lxml</tt> to become Cython.<ref>{{cite web|author=Says Sage and Cython developer Robert Bradshaw at the Sage Days 29 conference|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjSS2Rrvm0|title=Cython: Past, Present and Future|publisher=youtube.com|date=22 March 2011|accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref>  == Example == Cython files have a <code>.pyx</code> extension. At its most basic, Cython code looks exactly like Python code. However, whereas standard Python is [[dynamic typing|dynamically typed]], in Cython, types can optionally be provided, allowing for improved performance, allowing loops to be converted into C loops where possible. For example: <source lang="Python"> def primes(int kmax):  # The argument will be converted to int or raise a TypeError.     cdef int n, k, i  # These variables are declared with C types.     cdef int p[1000]  # Another C type     result = []  # A Python type     if kmax > 1000:         kmax = 1000     k = 0     n = 2     while k < kmax:         i = 0         while i < k and n % p[i] != 0:             i = i + 1         if i == k:             p[k] = n             k = k + 1             result.append(n)         n = n + 1     return result </source>  == Static type declarations and Performance == A Cython program that implements the same algorithm as a corresponding Python program may consume fewer computing resources such as core memory and processing cycles due to differences between the CPython and Cython execution models. On the one hand, a basic Python program is loaded and executed by the CPython [[virtual machine]], so both the runtime and the program itself consume computing resources. On the other hand, a Cython program is compiled to C code, which is further compiled to machine code, so the virtual machine is used only briefly when the program is loaded.<ref>{{cite web|last=Oliphant|first=Travis|date=2011-06-20|url=http://technicaldiscovery.blogspot.com/2011/06/speeding-up-python-numpy-cython-and.html|title=Technical Discovery: Speeding up Python (NumPy, Cython, and Weave)|publisher=Technicaldiscovery.blogspot.com|accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref><ref> {{cite journal|last1=Behnel|first1=Stefan|last2=Bradshaw|first2=Robert|last3=Citro|first3=Craig|last4=Dalcin|first4=Lisandro|last5=Seljebotn|first5=Dag Sverre|last6=Smith|first6=Kurt|year=2011 |title=Cython: The Best of Both Worlds |journal=Computing in Science and Engineering |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=31–39 |doi=10.1109/MCSE.2010.118 |url=http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36727.html}} </ref><ref name="scipy09"> {{cite journal|last=Seljebot|first=Dag Sverre|year=2009 |title=Fast numerical computations with Cython |journal=Proceedings of the 8 th Python in Science Conference (SciPy 2009) |pages=15–22 |url= http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/SciPy2009/paper_2}} </ref><ref> {{cite journal|last1=Wilbers|first1=I.|last2=Langtangen|first2=H.

As others have pointed out - these numbers are in units called "Mickeys" - and the size of a mickey depends on the sensitivity of your mouse.  Precisely how those numbers are arrived at depends on the kind of mouse you have.  :* The old fashioned mice with the ball inside have a pair of rollers that the ball pushes against - as the ball spins, the rollers are rotated and those in turn rotate a pair of disks with little holes cut into them all around.  As the disk spins, it interrupts a light beam and the teeny-tiny computer inside the mouse counts the number of times this happens in each direction and turns that into mickeys. :* Modern "optical" mice actually have an amazingly cheap/tiny camera inside them that looks down at your desk top and takes a picture of it many times a second.  When you move the mouse a small amount, the next picture is shifted a bit to one side compared to the previous one - and by figuring out how much it has to move the next picture to line up with the previous one, it knows how far the mouse moved.  This is why your mouse doesn't work on really smooth, uniformly colored surfaces...the pictures are all the same color all over!  The red LED underneath the mouse just provides enough light for the camera to see by (it's pretty dark under your mouse otherwise).  :The mickey data is sent along with the current state of the mouse's buttons and scroll wheel(s) to the computer either down a wire or over an infra-red or short-range radio link into some circuitry inside the computer proper - where it can be read by the operating system software.  The windowing system knows where the cursor is pointing at right now - and when the mouse says it moved (such-and-such number of mickey's to the left or right and such and such upwards or downwards), the software simply adds those numbers to the last position the cursor was at to get the new position.  If you change the mouse's sensitivity - then it may multiply or divide the number of mickeys by some number to convert it into pixels on the screen.  :The cursor can be drawn in one of two ways - it can just be rendered as graphics onto the screen (a "soft cursor") or the graphics chip may have special cursor-drawing hardware that can render a cursor at a specific place on the screen that the operating system can change.  :Application programs can also tell the operating system to move the cursor (typically used to "jump" it into a dialog box it just popped up or something) - this is called "warping the mouse" and it's generally frowned upon by user interface experts.  Programs can also load up different cursor shapes and tell the operating system what shape to use in which parts of the screen.  : [[User:SteveBaker|SteveBaker]] ([[User talk:SteveBaker|talk]]) 03:16, 16 September 2008 (UTC)  == IE 6 vs. 5 ==  'sup, bud.

[[User:Mr.K.|Mr.K.]] [[User_talk:Mr.K.|(talk)]] 11:52, 12 September 2008 (UTC)  : There's: :* Hosting - say you write an open-source timesheet-management program: your customers could download it and run it on their own servers, but you can offer them hosted service where you set it up and configure it for their requirements, host it on your (enterprise grade, redundant) servers in a secure data centre, and take care of stuff like security and backups for them. :* Hardware - you could be developing firmware for an embedded device like a storage array or a network device (like a firewall or entireprise spam filter).  By using open-source software you can get a lot of the basic stuff done fast, but you retain your advantage because much of your business's value-add is the hardware, which you own. :* Ancillary products - e.g. you write an open-source database which grabs some of Oracle's market, then you sell add-ons like backup systems and management programs and additional storage providers.  The degree to which you can do this is contingent on the open-source or free-software licence you choose, and the kind of linking you employ.  : And remember that with most OS/FS licences you can make money from your and others' OS/FS software by offering them as a web-service you can make changes and not release those changes back to the originating products (as you're allowing access to the software but not disseminating the software itself.

More Importantly, correct me if i'm wrong but doesn't the GPL say that the only people who are required to have the source distributed to them are people who correctly gained the binaries? So companies can very easily limit it, the consumers ability to then pass on their own modified source code aside. So actually, it doesn't have any bearing unless you just want to make up arguments why Open Source is better than Closed Source. I don't have an opinion either way because it's silly to think about outside to context of each individual product, and i've released as many open source tools as I have closed source. More importantly though, proprietary products can be open source.

Any other ideas for tools I should learn about?

If you are dealing with large datasets and wanting to perform manipulations on them, you probably will want to look into database programming. For example, it is pretty trivial to get Excel data into Microsoft Access, and from there you can pretty easily (with VBScript) perform systematic manipulations of the data that are custom-tailored to your need. Personally I find dealing with data in Access pretty much the bee's knees as long as you don't struggle with trying to creating custom user interfaces (forms, etc.) for all of it (which is where Access at first appears convenient but quickly becomes burdensome).  :Just as an example, here is some sample VB code that goes over a given table (the equivalent of an Excel worksheet), extracts the data from certain fields, does something with them, and then outputs everything into a new field:  <code> ::dim rst as DAO.Recordset ::dim runningTotalOfJohns as Integer; ::set rst = CurrentDB.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM myTable") ::while not rst.eof :::if rst("name") = "John" then runningTotalOfJohns = runningTotalOfJohns + 1 :::if rst("name")="John" and rst("birthday")="09/12/2008" then  ::::rst.edit ::::rst("message")="happy birthday, John!" ::::rst.update :::end if :::rst.movenext ::wend ::rst.close </code> :As you can probably grasp, this gives you a lot more control over dealing with the data and allows you to express your intentions in a much more logical fashion, rather than making dense little lines like in Excel.  :There are other database and code solutions other than Access and VBScript (MySQL is a common free database backend, and you can couple it with PHP and other scripting languages, and there is also OpenOffice.org Base, which is supposed to be a free analog to MS Access, but frankly I find it pretty unusable at the moment), I'm just using it as an example. The point is, this seems to me like the graduation you are talking about in regards to dealing with data—something of this sort. --[[Special:Contributions/98.217.8.46|98.217.8.46]] ([[User talk:98.217.8.46|talk]]) 23:36, 12 September 2008 (UTC)  : I love [[MATLAB]] and it's well suited to all sorts of data-manipulation problems.

There are free programming languages like [[GNU Octave|Octave]] and [[R (programming language)|R]] that can do a lot of the same things, but I found the MATLAB IDE a lot nicer to work in, especially for interactively playing around with arrays of data.  -- [[User:Coneslayer|Coneslayer]] ([[User talk:Coneslayer|talk]]) 01:46, 13 September 2008 (UTC) :::Thank you all for your thoughtful comments!

That reflects my own issues with SQL, though—if you can use basic SQL with a scripting language you can do a million things as once, in a much more comfortable syntax, with only a slight performance hit over doing it all at the same time with raw SQL. --[[Special:Contributions/98.217.8.46|98.217.8.46]] ([[User talk:98.217.8.46|talk]]) 15:38, 13 September 2008 (UTC)  :If you're happy with Excel's performance but just frustrated with how complicated it gets, I'd suggest sticking with it but writing new functions in VBA rather than by combining existing functions directly in the sheet.

"<page><title>Scale space</title><text>{{ScaleSpaceNavbox}}  '''Scale-space''' theory is a framework for [[Multiscale mathematics|multi-scale]] [[Signal (information theory)|signal]] [[Knowledge representation|representation]] developed by the [[computer vision]], [[image processing]] and [[signal processing]] communities with complementary motivations from [[physics]] and [[biological vision]]. It is a formal theory for handling image structures at different [[Scale (ratio)|scale]]s, by representing an image as a one-parameter family of smoothed images, the '''scale-space representation''', parametrized by the size of the smoothing [[convolution kernel|kernel]] used for suppressing fine-scale structures.<ref name=wit83 /><ref name=koe84 /><ref name=lin94 /><ref name=lin94review /><ref name=flo97 /><ref name="sporring-etal-1997" /><ref name=rom03 /> The parameter <math>t</math> in this family is referred to as the ''scale parameter'', with the interpretation that image structures of spatial size smaller than about <math>\sqrt{t}</math> have largely been smoothed away in the scale-space level at scale <math>t</math>.  The main type of scale space is the ''linear (Gaussian) scale space'', which has wide applicability as well as the attractive property of being possible to derive from a small set of ''[[scale-space axioms]]''.  The corresponding scale-space framework encompasses a theory for Gaussian derivative operators, which can be used as a basis for expressing a large class of visual operations for computerized  systems that process visual information.  This framework also allows visual operations to be made ''[[scale invariant]]'', which is necessary for dealing with the size variations that may occur in image data, because real-world objects may be of different sizes and in addition the distance between the object and the camera may be unknown and may vary depending on the circumstances.<ref name=lin08 /><ref name=lin14compvisrefguide />  ==Definition== The notion of scale space applies to signals of arbitrary numbers of variables.  The most common case in the literature applies to two-dimensional images, which is what is presented here.  For a given image <math>f(x, y)</math>, its linear (Gaussian) ''scale-space representation'' is a family of derived signals <math>L(x, y; t)</math> defined by the [[convolution]] of <math>f(x, y)</math> with the two-dimensional [[Gaussian kernel]]  :<math>g(x, y; t) = \frac {1}{2 \pi t}e^{-(x^2+y^2)/2t}\, </math> such that :<math>L(\cdot, \cdot ; t)\ = g(\cdot, \cdot ; t) * f(\cdot, \cdot) ,</math>  where the semicolon in the argument of <math> L </math> implies that the convolution is performed only over the variables <math>x, y</math>, while the scale parameter <math>t</math> after the semicolon just indicates which scale level is being defined.  This definition of <math> L </math> works for a continuum of scales <math>t  \geq 0</math>, but typically only a finite discrete set of levels in the scale-space representation would be actually considered.  The scale parameteter <math>t = \sigma^2</math> is the [[variance]] of the Gaussian filter and as a limit for <math> t = 0 </math> the filter <math> g </math> becomes an impulse function such that <math>L(x, y; 0) = f(x, y), </math> that is, the scale-space representation at scale level <math>t = 0</math> is the image <math> f </math> itself.  As <math> t </math> increases, <math> L </math> is the result of smoothing <math> f </math> with a larger and larger filter, thereby removing more and more of the details which the image contains.  Since the standard deviation of the filter is <math>\sigma = \sqrt{t} </math>, details which are significantly smaller than this value are to a large extent removed from the image at scale parameter <math> t </math>, see the following figure and <ref name="lin-cern" /> for graphical illustrations.  <gallery widths="286" heights="205" perrow="2"> Image:Scalespace0.png|Scale-space representation <math>L(x,y;t)</math>  at scale <math>t=0</math>, corresponding to the original image <math>f</math> Image:Scalespace1.png|Scale-space representation <math>L(x,y;t)</math> at scale <math>t=1</math> Image:Scalespace2.png|Scale-space representation <math>L(x,y;t)</math> at scale <math>t=4</math> Image:Scalespace3.png|Scale-space representation <math>L(x,y;t)</math> at scale <math>t=16</math> Image:Scalespace4.png|Scale-space representation <math>L(x,y;t)</math> at scale <math>t=64</math> Image:Scalespace5.png|Scale-space representation <math>L(x,y;t)</math> at scale <math>t=256</math> </gallery>  ===Why a Gaussian filter?=== When faced with the task of generating a multi-scale representation one may ask: could any filter ''g'' of low-pass type and with a parameter ''t'' which determines its width be used to generate a scale space? The answer is no, as it is of crucial importance that the smoothing filter does not introduce new spurious structures at coarse scales that do not correspond to simplifications of corresponding structures at finer scales. In the scale-space literature, a number of different ways have been expressed to formulate this criterion in precise mathematical terms.  The conclusion from several different axiomatic derivations that have been presented is that the Gaussian scale space constitutes the ''canonical'' way to generate a linear scale space, based on the essential requirement that new structures must not be created when going from a fine scale to any coarser scale.<ref name=koe84/><ref name=lin94/><ref name=flo97/><ref name=lin08/><ref name="Babaud-EtAl" /><ref name="Yuille-Poggio" /><ref name="Lindeberg-1990" /><ref name="Pauwels-EtAl" /><ref name="Lindeberg-1997" /><ref name="Weickert-1999" /><ref name="Lin11" /><ref name="Lin13-AIEP" /> Conditions, referred to as ''[[scale-space axioms]]'', that have been used for deriving the uniqueness of the Gaussian kernel include [[linearity]], [[shift invariance]], [[semi-group]] structure, non-enhancement of [[local extrema]], [[scale invariance]] and [[rotational invariance]]. In the paper <ref>The Monogenic Scale-Space: A Unifying Approach to Phase-Based Image Processing in Scale Space (2002)</ref>by M. Felsberg, the uniqueness claimed in the seminal work by Iijima (1962) has been criticized, and the alternative linear scale-space Laplace kernel has been proposed.  ===Alternative definition=== ''Equivalently'', the scale-space family can be defined as the solution of the [[diffusion equation]] (for example in terms of the [[heat equation]]),  :<math>\partial_t L = \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 L,</math>  with initial condition <math>L(x, y; 0) = f(x, y)</math>.  This formulation of the scale-space representation ''L'' means that it is possible to interpret the intensity values of the image ''f'' as a "temperature distribution" in the image plane and that the process which generates the scale-space representation as a function of ''t'' corresponds to heat diffusion in the image plane over time ''t'' (assuming the thermal conductivity of the material equal to the arbitrarily chosen constant ½).  Although this connection may appear superficial for a reader not familiar with [[differential equation]]s, it is indeed the case that the main scale-space formulation in terms of non-enhancement of local extrema is expressed in terms of a sign condition on [[partial derivative]]s in the 2+1-D volume generated by the scale space, thus within the framework of [[partial differential equation]]s. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the discrete case shows that the diffusion equation provides a unifying link between continuous and discrete scale spaces, which also generalizes to nonlinear scale spaces, for example, using [[anisotropic diffusion]]. Hence, one may say that the primary way to generate a scale space is by the diffusion equation, and that the Gaussian kernel arises as the [[Green's function]] of this specific partial differential equation.  ==Motivations== The motivation for generating a scale-space representation of a given data set originates from the basic observation that real-world objects are composed of different structures at different [[Scale (ratio)|scales]]. This implies that real-world objects, in contrast to idealized mathematical entities such as [[Point (geometry)|points]] or [[Line (geometry)|line]]s, may appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation. For example, the concept of a "tree" is appropriate at the scale of meters, while concepts such as leaves and molecules are more appropriate at finer scales. For a [[computer vision]] system analysing an unknown scene, there is no way to know a priori what [[Scale (ratio)|scales]] are appropriate for describing the interesting structures in the image data. Hence, the only reasonable approach is to consider descriptions at multiple scales in order to be able to capture the unknown scale variations that may occur. Taken to the limit, a scale-space representation considers representations at all scales.<ref name=lin08/>  Another motivation to the scale-space concept originates from the process of performing a physical measurement on real-world data. In order to extract any information from a measurement process, one has to apply ''operators of non-infinitesimal size'' to the data. In many branches of computer science and applied mathematics, the size of the measurement operator is disregarded in the theoretical modelling of a problem. The scale-space theory on the other hand explicitly incorporates the need for a non-infinitesimal size of the image operators as an integral part of any measurement as well as any other operation that depends on a real-world measurement.<ref name=lin94review/>  There is a close link between scale-space theory and biological vision. Many scale-space operations show a high degree of similarity with receptive field profiles recorded from the mammalian retina and the first stages in the visual cortex. In these respects, the scale-space framework can be seen as a theoretically well-founded paradigm for early vision, which in addition has been thoroughly tested by algorithms and experiments.<ref name=lin94/><ref name=lin08/>  ==Gaussian derivatives==  At any scale in scale space, we can apply local derivative operators to the scale-space representation:  :<math>L_{x^m y^n}(x, y; t) = \left( \partial_{x^m y^n}  L \right)(x, y; t) .</math>  Due to the commutative property between the derivative operator and the Gaussian smoothing operator, such ''scale-space derivatives'' can equivalently be computed by convolving the original image with Gaussian derivative operators. For this reason they are often also referred to as ''Gaussian derivatives'':  :<math>L_{x^m y^n}(\cdot, \cdot; t) =  \partial_{x^m y^n} g(\cdot, \cdot;\, t) * f (\cdot, \cdot).</math>  Interestingly, the uniqueness of the Gaussian derivative operators as local operations derived from a scale-space representation can be obtained by similar axiomatic derivations as are used for deriving the uniqueness of the Gaussian kernel for scale-space smoothing.<ref name=lin94/><ref name="Koenderink-vanDoorn" />  ===Visual front end=== These Gaussian derivative operators can in turn be combined by linear or non-linear operators into a larger variety of different types of feature detectors, which in many cases can be well modelled by [[differential geometry]]. Specifically, invariance (or more appropriately ''covariance'') to local geometric transformations, such as rotations or local affine transformations, can be obtained by considering differential invariants under the appropriate class of transformations or alternatively by normalizing the Gaussian derivative operators to a locally determined coordinate frame determined from e.g. a preferred orientation in the image domain or by applying a preferred local affine transformation to a local image patch (see the article on [[affine shape adaptation]] for further details).  When Gaussian derivative operators and differential invariants are used in this way as basic feature detectors at multiple scales, the uncommitted first stages of visual processing are often referred to as a ''visual front-end''. This overall framework has been applied to a large variety of problems in computer vision, including [[feature detection]], [[Statistical classification|feature classification]], [[scale-space segmentation|image segmentation]], [[image registration|image matching]], [[motion estimation]], computation of [[shape]] cues and [[object recognition]]. The set of Gaussian derivative operators up to a certain order is often referred to as the ''[[N-jet]]'' and constitutes a basic type of feature within the scale-space framework.  ==Detector examples== Following the idea of expressing visual operation in terms of differential invariants computed at multiple scales using Gaussian derivative operators, we can express an [[edge detection|edge detector]] from the set of points that satisfy the requirement that the gradient magnitude :<math>L_v = \sqrt{L_x^2 + L_y^2}^T</math> should assume a local maximum in the gradient direction :<math>\nabla L = (L_x, L_y)^T.</math> By working out the differential geometry, it can be shown <ref name=lin94/> that this [[edge detection#Differential edge detection|differential edge detector]] can equivalently be expressed from the zero-crossings of the second-order differential invariant  :<math>{\tilde L}_v^2 = L_x^2 \, L_{xx} + 2 \, L_x \,  L_y \, L_{xy} + L_y^2 \, L_{yy} = 0</math>  that satisfy the following sign condition on a third-order differential invariant:  :<math>{\tilde L}_v^3 = L_x^3 \, L_{xxx} + 3 \, L_x^2 \, L_y \, L_{xxy} + 3 \, L_x \, L_y^2 \, L_{xyy} + L_y^3 \, L_{yyy} < 0.</math>  Similarly, multi-scale [[blob detection|blob detectors]] at any given fixed scale<ref name=lin08/> can be obtained from local maxima and local minima of either the [[Laplacian]] operator (also referred to as the [[Laplacian of Gaussian]])  :<math>\nabla^2 L = L_{xx} + L_{yy} \, </math>  or [[blob detection#The determinant of the Hessian|the determinant of the Hessian matrix]] :<math>\operatorname{det} H L(x, y; t) = (L_{xx} L_{yy} - L_{xy}^2).</math> In an analogous fashion, corner detectors and ridge and valley detectors can be expressed as local maxima, minima or zero-crossings of multi-scale differential invariants defined from Gaussian derivatives. The algebraic expressions for the corner and ridge detection operators are, however, somewhat more complex and the reader is referred to the articles on [[corner detection]] and [[ridge detection]] for further details.  Scale-space operations have also been frequently used for expressing coarse-to-fine methods, in particular for tasks such as [[image registration|image matching]] and for [[scale-space segmentation|multi-scale image segmentation]].  ==Scale selection== The theory presented so far describes a well-founded framework for ''representing'' image structures at multiple scales. In many cases it is, however, also necessary to select locally appropriate scales for further analysis. This need for ''scale selection'' originates from two major reasons; (i) real-world objects may have different size, and  this size may be unknown to the vision system, and (ii) the distance between the object and the camera can vary, and this distance information may also be unknown ''a priori''. A highly useful property of scale-space representation is that image representations can be made invariant to scales, by performing automatic local scale selection<ref name=lin08/><ref name=lin14compvisrefguide /><ref name=lin98 /><ref name=lin98b /><ref name=lin99cvhandbook /> based on local [[Maxima and minima|maxima]] (or [[minima]]) over scales of normalized [[derivative]]s :<math>L_{\xi^m \eta^n}(x, y; t) = t^{(m+n) \gamma/2} L_{x^m y^n}(x, y; t)</math> where <math>\gamma \in [0,1]</math> is a parameter that is related to the dimensionality of the image feature. This algebraic expression for ''scale normalized Gaussian derivative operators'' originates from the introduction of ''<math>\gamma</math>-normalized derivatives'' according to :<math>\partial_{\xi} = t^{\gamma/2} \partial_x\quad</math> and <math>\quad\partial_{\eta} = t^{\gamma/2} \partial_y.</math> It can be theoretically shown that a scale selection module working according to this principle will satisfy the following ''scale invariance property'': if for a certain type of image feature a local maximum is assumed in a certain image at a certain scale <math>t_0</math>, then under a rescaling of the image by a scale factor <math>s</math> the local maximum over scales in the rescaled image will be transformed to the scale level <math>s^2 t_0</math>.  ===Scale invariant feature detection===  Following this approach of gamma-normalized derivatives, it can be shown that different types of ''scale adaptive and scale invariant [[feature detection|feature detectors]]''<ref name=lin08/><ref name=lin14compvisrefguide/><ref name=lin98/><ref name=lin98b/><ref name=lin99cvhandbook/> can be expressed for tasks such as [[blob detection]], [[corner detection]], [[ridge detection]] and [[edge detection]] (see the specific articles on these topics for in-depth descriptions of how these scale-invariant feature detectors are formulated). Furthermore, the scale levels obtained from automatic scale selection can be used for determining regions of interest for subsequent [[affine shape adaptation]]<ref name=lingar97 /> to obtain affine invariant interest points<ref name="Baumberg-2000" /><ref name="Mikolajczyk-Schmid" /> or for determining scale levels for computing associated [[image descriptors]], such as locally scale adapted [[N-jet]]s.  Recent work has shown that also more complex operations, such as scale-invariant [[object recognition]] can be performed in this way, by computing local image descriptors (N-jets or local histograms of gradient directions) at scale-adapted interest points obtained from scale-space extrema of the normalized [[Laplacian]] operator (see also [[scale-invariant feature transform]]<ref name="Lowe-2004" />) or the determinant of the Hessian (see also [[SURF]]);<ref name="Bay-EtAl" /> see also the Scholarpedia article on the [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Scale_Invariant_Feature_Transform scale-invariant feature transform]<ref name="Lindeberg-Scholarpedia" /> for a more general outlook of object recognition approaches based on receptive field responses<ref name="Lin13-AIEP" /><ref name="Schiele-Crowley" /><ref name="Linde-Lindeberg-2004" /><ref name="Linde-Lindeberg-2012" /> in terms Gaussian derivative operators or approximations thereof.  ==Related multi-scale representations== An image  [[Pyramid (image processing)|pyramid]] is a discrete representation in which a scale space is sampled in both space and scale. For scale invariance, the scale factors should be sampled exponentially, for example as integer powers of 2 or root 2.  When properly constructed, the ratio of the sample rates in space and scale are held constant so that the impulse response is identical in all levels of the pyramid.<ref name="Burt-Adelson" /><ref name="Crowley-Sanderson" /><ref name="Lindeberg-Bretzner" />  Fast, O(N), algorithms exist for computing a scale invariant image pyramid in which the image or signal is repeatedly smoothed then subsampled.   Values for  scale space between pyramid samples can easily be estimated using interpolation within and between scales and allowing for scale and position estimates with sub resolution accuracy.<ref name="Lindeberg-Bretzner" />  In a scale-space representation, the existence of a continuous scale parameter makes it possible to track zero crossings over scales leading to so-called ''deep structure''. For features defined as [[zero-crossing]]s of [[differential invariant]]s, the [[implicit function theorem]] directly defines [[trajectory|trajectories]] across scales,<ref name=lin94/><ref name=lin92jmiv /> and at those scales where [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]]s occur, the local behaviour can be modelled by [[singularity theory]].<ref name=lin94/><ref name=lin92jmiv/><ref name="Koendering-vanDoorn-1986" /><ref name="Damon-1995" />  Extensions of linear scale-space theory concern the formulation of non-linear scale-space concepts more committed to specific purposes.<ref name="Romeny-1994" /><ref name="Weickert-1998" /> These ''[[non-linear scale-space]]s'' often start from the equivalent diffusion formulation of the scale-space concept, which is subsequently extended in a non-linear fashion. A large number of evolution equations have been formulated in this way, motivated by different specific requirements (see the abovementioned book references for further information). It should be noted, however, that not all of these non-linear scale-spaces satisfy similar "nice" theoretical requirements as the linear Gaussian scale-space concept. Hence, unexpected artifacts may sometimes occur and one should be very careful of not using the term "scale-space" for just any type of one-parameter family of images.  A [[first-order extension]] of the [[isotropic Gaussian scale space]] is provided by the ''affine (Gaussian) scale space''.<ref name=lin94/> One motivation for this extension originates from the common need for computing image descriptors subject for real-world objects that are viewed under a [[perspective camera model]]. To handle such non-linear deformations locally, [[partial invariance]] (or more correctly [[covariance]]) to local [[affine deformation]]s can be achieved by considering affine Gaussian kernels with their shapes determined by the local image structure,<ref name=lingar97/> see the article on [[affine shape adaptation]] for theory and algorithms. Indeed, this affine scale space can also be expressed from a non-isotropic extension of the linear (isotropic) diffusion equation, while still being within the class of linear [[partial differential equation]]s.

There has also been work on other [[multi-scale approaches]], such as pyramids and a variety of other kernels, that do not exploit or require the same requirements as true scale-space descriptions do.  ==Biological vision== There are interesting relations between scale-space representation and biological vision. Neurophysiological studies have shown that there are [[receptive field]] profiles in the mammalian [[retina]] and [[visual cortex]], which can be well modelled by linear Gaussian derivative operators, in some cases also complemented by a non-isotropic affine scale-space model, a spatio-temporal scale-space model and/or non-linear combinations of such linear operators.<ref name=Lin11 /><ref name=Lin13BICY/><ref name=Lin13PONE /><ref name="Young-1987" /><ref name="DeAngelis-EtAl" />  ==Implementation issues== When implementing scale-space smoothing in practice there are a number of different approaches that can be taken in terms of continuous or discrete Gaussian smoothing, implementation in the Fourier domain, in terms of pyramids based on binomial filters that approximate the Gaussian or using recursive filters.

"<page><title>Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion</title><text>{{refimprove|date=April 2009}}  In [[control theory|control system theory]], the '''Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion''' is a mathematical test that is a necessary and sufficient condition  for the [[stable polynomial|stability]] of a [[linear function|linear]] [[time invariant]] (LTI) [[control system]]. The Routh test is an efficient recursive algorithm that English mathematician [[Edward John Routh]] proposed in 1876 to determine whether all the [[root of a function|roots]] of the [[characteristic polynomial]] of a [[linear system]] have negative real parts.<ref>{{cite book |last=Routh |first=E. J. |year=1877 |title=A Treatise on the Stability of a Given State of Motion: Particularly Steady Motion |publisher=Macmillan |isbn= }}</ref> German mathematician [[Adolf Hurwitz]] independently proposed in 1895 to arrange the coefficients of the polynomial into a square matrix, called the Hurwitz matrix, and showed that the polynomial is stable if and only if the sequence of determinants of its principal submatrices are all positive.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hurwitz |first=A. |year=1895 |title=Ueber die Bedingungen, unter welchen eine Gleichung nur Wurzeln mit negativen reellen Theilen besitzt |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen|Math.

Bergmann in ''Selected Papers on Mathematical Trends in Control Theory'' R. Bellman and R. Kalaba Eds. New York: Dover, 1964 pp. 70–82.)</ref> The two procedures are equivalent, with the Routh test providing a more efficient way to compute the Hurwitz determinants than computing them directly.  A polynomial satisfying the Routh–Hurwitz criterion is called a [[Hurwitz polynomial]].  The importance of the criterion is that the roots '''''p''''' of the characteristic equation of a [[linear system]] with negative real parts represent solutions '''''e<sup>pt</sup>''''' of the system that are stable ([[BIBO stability|bounded]]).  Thus the criterion provides a way to determine if the [[equations of motion]] of a [[linear system]] have only stable solutions, without solving the system directly.  For discrete systems, the corresponding stability test can be handled by the Schur–Cohn criterion, the [[Jury stability criterion|Jury test]] and the [[Bistritz stability criterion|Bistritz test]].  With the advent of computers, the criterion has become less widely used, as an alternative is to solve the polynomial numerically, obtaining approximations to the roots directly.  The Routh test can [[Derivation of the Routh array|be derived]] through the use of the [[euclid's algorithm|Euclidean algorithm]] and [[Sturm's theorem]] in evaluating [[cauchy index|Cauchy indices]]. Hurwitz derived his conditions differently.<ref name="Gopal">{{cite book   | last = Gopal   | first = M.   | title = Control Systems: Principles and Design, 2nd Ed.   | publisher = Tata McGraw-Hill Education   | date = 2002   | location =    | pages = 14   | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=FZak6CkrVLQC&pg=PA14&dq=%22flyball+governor   | doi =    | id =    | isbn = 0070482896}}</ref>  ==Using Euclid's algorithm==  The criterion is related to [[Routh–Hurwitz theorem]].  Indeed, from the statement of that theorem, we have <math>p-q=w(+\infty)-w(-\infty)</math> where: * ''p'' is the number of roots of the polynomial ''ƒ''(''z'') with negative Real Part; * ''q'' is the number of roots of the polynomial ''ƒ''(''z'') with positive Real Part (let us remind ourselves that ''ƒ'' is supposed to have no roots lying on the imaginary line); * ''w''(''x'') is the number of variations of the [[Sturm's theorem#Generalized Sturm chains|generalized Sturm chain]] obtained from <math>P_0(y)</math> and <math>P_1(y)</math> (by successive [[Euclid's algorithm|Euclidean divisions]]) where <math>f(iy)=P_0(y)+iP_1(y)</math> for a real ''y''. By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], each polynomial of degree ''n'' must have ''n'' roots in the complex plane (i.e., for an ''ƒ'' with no roots on the imaginary line, ''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n'').  Thus, we have the condition that ''ƒ'' is a (Hurwitz) [[stable polynomial]] if and only if ''p''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n'' (the [[Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion#Appendix A|proof]] is given below).  Using the Routh–Hurwitz theorem, we can replace the condition on ''p'' and ''q'' by a condition on the generalized Sturm chain, which will give in turn a condition on the coefficients of&nbsp;''ƒ''.  ==Using matrices==  Let ''f''(''z'') be a complex polynomial.  The process is as follows: # Compute the polynomials <math>P_0(y)</math> and <math>P_1(y)</math> such that <math>f(iy)=P_0(y)+iP_1(y)</math> where ''y'' is a real number. # Compute the [[Sylvester matrix]] associated to  <math>P_0(y)</math> and  <math>P_1(y)</math>. # Rearrange each row in such a way that an odd row and the following one have the same number of leading zeros. # Compute each [[minor (linear algebra)|principal minor]] of that matrix. # If at least one of the minors is negative (or zero), then the polynomial ''f'' is not stable.  ===Example===  * Let <math>f(z)=az^2+bz+c</math> (for the sake of simplicity we take real coefficients) where <math> c\neq 0</math> (to avoid a root in zero so that we can use the Routh–Hurwitz theorem).  First, we have to calculate the real polynomials <math>P_0(y)</math> and <math>P_1(y)</math>: :: <math>f(iy)=-ay^2+iby+c=P_0(y)+iP_1(y)=-ay^2+c+i(by).</math> : Next, we divide those polynomials to obtain the generalized Sturm chain: :* <math>P_0(y)=((-a/b)y)P_1(y)+c,</math> yields <math> P_2(y)=-c,</math> :* <math>P_1(y)=((-b/c)y)P_2(y),</math> yields <math>P_3(y)=0</math> and the [[Euclid's algorithm|Euclidean division]] stops. Notice that we had to suppose ''b'' different from zero in the first division.  The generalized Sturm chain is in this case <math>(P_0(y),P_1(y),P_2(y))=(c-ay^2,by,-c)</math>.  Putting <math>y=+\infty</math>, the sign of <math>c-ay^2</math> is the opposite sign of ''a'' and the sign of ''by'' is the sign of ''b''.  When we put <math>y=-\infty</math>, the sign of the first element of the chain is again the opposite sign of ''a'' and the sign of ''by'' is the opposite sign of ''b''.  Finally, -''c'' has always the opposite sign of ''c''.  Suppose now that ''f'' is Hurwitz-stable.  This means that <math>w(+\infty)-w(-\infty)=2</math> (the degree of ''f'').  By the properties of the function ''w'', this is the same as <math>w(+\infty)=2</math> and <math>w(-\infty)=0</math>.  Thus, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' must have the same sign.   We have thus found the [[stable polynomial#Properties|necessary condition of stability]] for polynomials of degree 2.  ===Routh–Hurwitz criterion for second, third, and fourth-order polynomials===  In the following, we assume the coefficient of the highest order (e.g. <math>a_2</math> in a second order polynomial) to be positive. If necessary, this can always be achieved by multiplication of the polynomial with <math>-1</math>.  * For a second-order polynomial, <math> P(s) = a_2s^2 + a_1s + a_0 = 0 </math>, all the roots are in the left half plane (and the system with characteristic equation <math> P(s) </math> is stable) if all the coefficients satisfy <math> a_n > 0 </math>. * For a third-order polynomial <math> P(s) = a_3s^3 + a_2s^2 + a_1s + a_0 = 0</math>, all the coefficients must satisfy <math> a_n > 0 </math>, and <math> a_2a_1 > a_3a_0 </math> *For a fourth-order polynomial <math> P(s) = a_4s^4 + a_3s^3 + a_2s^2 + a_1s + a_0 = 0 </math>, all the coefficients must satisfy <math> a_n > 0 </math>, and <math> a_3a_2 > a_4a_1</math> and <math> a_3a_2a_1 > a_4a_1^2 + a_3^2a_0 </math> * In general Routh stability criterion proclaims that all First column elements of Routh array is to be of same sign. System meeting the above criteria is said to closed loop stable otherwise unstable because there is sign changes in the first column elements.  ===Higher-order example===  A tabular method can be used to determine the stability when the roots of a higher order characteristic polynomial are difficult to obtain. For an ''n''th-degree polynomial * <math>D(s)=a_ns^n+a_{n-1}s^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1s+a_0</math> the table has ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 rows and the following structure: {| class="wikitable" width="200px"  | <math>a_n</math> || <math>a_{n-2}</math> || <math>a_{n-4}</math> || <math>\dots</math>  |-  | <math>a_{n-1}</math> || <math>a_{n-3}</math> || <math>a_{n-5}</math> || <math>\dots</math>  |-  | <math>b_1</math> || <math>b_2</math> || <math>b_3</math> || <math>\dots</math>  |-  | <math>c_1</math> || <math>c_2</math> || <math>c_3</math> || <math>\dots</math>  |-  | <math>\vdots</math> || <math>\vdots</math> || <math>\vdots</math> || <math>\ddots</math>  |} where the elements <math>b_i</math> and <math>c_i</math> can be computed as follows: * <math>b_i=\frac{a_{n-1}\times{a_{n-2i}}-a_n\times{a_{n-2i-1}}}{a_{n-1}}.</math> * <math>c_i=\frac{b_1\times{a_{n-2i-1}}-a_{n-1}\times{b_{i+1}}}{b_1}.</math> When completed, the number of sign changes in the first column will be the number of non-negative poles. {| class="wikitable"  |-  | width="40px" |0.75  | width="40px" |1.5  | width="40px" |0  | width="40px" |0  |-  |<nowiki>-3</nowiki>||6||0||0  |-  |3||0||0||0  |-  |6||0||0||0 |} In the first column, there are two sign changes (0.75&nbsp;→&nbsp;−3, and −3&nbsp;→&nbsp;3), thus there are two non-negative roots where the system is unstable.  Sometimes the presence of poles on the imaginary axis creates a situation of marginal stability. In that case the coefficients of the "Routh Array" in a whole row become zero and thus further solution of the polynomial for finding changes in sign is not possible. Then another approach comes into play. The row of polynomial which is just above the row containing the zeroes is called "Auxiliary Polynomial".  * <math>s^6+2s^5+8s^4+12s^3+20s^2+16s+16=0.\,</math> We have the following table: {| class="wikitable"  |-  | width="40px"|1|| width="40px"|8|| width="40px"|20|| width="40px"|16  |-  | 2    || 12  || 16 || 0  |-  | 2    || 12  || 16 || 0  |-  | 0    || 0   ||  0 || 0  |} In such a case the Auxiliary polynomial is <math>A(s)=2s^4+12s^2+16.\,</math> which is again equal to zero. The next step is to differentiate the above equation which yields the following polynomial. <math>B(s)=8s^3+24s^1.\,</math>. The coefficients of the row containing zero now become "8" and "24". The process of Routh array is proceeded using these values which yield two points on the imaginary axis. These two points on the imaginary axis are the prime cause of marginal stability.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saeed|first=Syed Hasan|title=Automatic Control Systems|year=2008|publisher=Katson Publishers|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-906919-2-5|pages=206, 207}}</ref>  ==See also==  * [[Control engineering]] * [[Derivation of the Routh array]] * [[Nyquist stability criterion]] * [[Routh–Hurwitz theorem]] * [[Root locus]] * [[Transfer function]] * [[Jury stability criterion]] * [[Bistritz stability criterion]] * [[Kharitonov's theorem]] * [[Liénard–Chipart criterion]]  ==References==  {{reflist}} * {{cite journal  | author = Gantmacher, F.
